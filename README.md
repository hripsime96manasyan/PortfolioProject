# PortfolioProject

As an entry level Data Analyst, I've created this repository to keep the projects I work on and keep tracing the skills and experience I got in SQL.

In the first project I've used SQL to do some Data Exploration on an actual theme nowadays - Covid, the data has been used for visualization in Tableu. 

Check out the visulatization in my Tableu Public Profile:https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hripsime3569#!/.

Within the 2nd SQL project, Olympic games history has been analized with list of queries from different levels.
Historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games has been imported to SQL from Kaggle, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016.


In the 3rd project, I did movie correlation with Python: looking at variables which effect the gross revenue from movies.
