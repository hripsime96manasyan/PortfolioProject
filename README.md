# PortfolioProject
“The very first thing, we must do when writing SQL queries, is to understand the underlying data. Once we understand the data and how this data is stored across different tables, it becomes much simpler to write SQL Queries to retrieve any information from that data”

As an entry level Data Analyst, I've created this repository to keep the projects I work on and keep tracing the skills and experience I got in SQL.

In the first project I've used SQL to do some Data Exploration on an actual theme nowadays - Covid, later the data will be used for visualization in Tableu.
Data has been imported from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#explore-the-global-situation.

Within the 2nd project, Olympic games history has been analized with list of queries from different levels.
Historical data has been imported to SQL from Kaggle
